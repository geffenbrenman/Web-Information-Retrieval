This is an ongoing project as part of the course Web Information Retrieval <br>
taught by Professor Sara Cohen. <br>
This is a search engine for product reviews. <br>
All datasets were taken from [Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html).

## Index Writer

* Each product review have the same format.    
  
* The purpose is to reveal a hidden picture by linking the pairs and painting the paths so that    
  the number of squares in the path, including the squares at the ends,     
  equals the value of the numbers being linked together.    


## Index Reader

After an index has been created on disk, the class IndexReader can be used <br/>
to access many different types of information available in the index. <br/>
These operations are implemented in a manner that they are efficient even when the index contains huge <br/>
amounts of data.
